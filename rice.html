    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This isn’t your everyday coconut rice recipe. A couple of special added ingredients to this coconut ginger rice are sushi ginger (you know… the kind that comes with your sushi) and pesto. That means there are some incredible flavor components going on in this fabulous rice side dish! Rice can sometimes be kind of boring, but this rice is not boring at all.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingrediants needed:</h3>
    <ul>-butter
        -sushi ginger
        -minced garlic
        -onion
        -Jasmine rice

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        1. In a medium-sized skillet over medium heat, melt the butter.
        2. Add the ginger, garlic and onions, stir frequently until the onions are transparent.
           Add the rice, turning frequently until well coated. Add the coconut milk, water, salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes (until the liquid is absorbed.)
        3. Remove from heat and let stand 5 to 6 minutes. Spoon the rice into a serving bowl, add the basil pesto and toss with fork to fluff and distribute the flavor.
